This repository aims to centralize all Zigbee documentation that I have the opportunity to read/collect (French translation).

Newbie on domoticz and zigbee devices, I'm trying to centralize here various How-to, information I can collect on the web.

I propose also some translation of those documentation collected.
Obviously, the translations are refering to the source in order to keep the possibility to read the original text in case of misunderstoods.
